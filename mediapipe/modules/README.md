# Modules

Each module (represented as a subfolder) provides subgraphs and corresponding resources (e.g. tflite models) to perform domain-specific tasks (e.g. detect hands, detect hand landmarks).

*Modules listed below are already used in some of `mediapipe/graphs` and more graphs are being migrated to use existing and upcoming modules.*

| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`hand_landmark`](hand_landmark/README.md) | Subgraphs to detect and track hand landmarks. |
| [`palm_detection`](palm_detection/README.md) | Subgraphs to detect palms/hands. |
